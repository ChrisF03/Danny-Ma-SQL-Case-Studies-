**Query #1** <br>
How many runners signed up for each 1 week period? (i.e. week starts 2021-01-01)
```sql
    With signups AS (
    SELECT runner_id,
    	     registration_date,
    	     registration_date - ((registration_date - '2021-01-01') % 7) AS starting_week
    FROM pizza_runner.runners
    )
    SELECT starting_week,
           COUNT(runner_id) AS Total_Runners
    FROM signups
    GROUP BY starting_week
    ORDER BY starting_week;
```
| starting_week            | total_runners |
| ------------------------ | ------------- |
| 2021-01-01T00:00:00.000Z | 2             |

**Query #2** <br>
What was the average time in minutes it took for each runner to arrive at the Pizza Runner HQ to pickup the order?
```sql
    With arrival AS (
    SELECT r.runner_id,
    	     r.pickup_time,
           (r.pickup_time - c.order_time) AS arrival_time
    FROM new_runner_orders AS r 
    JOIN new_customer_orders AS c ON
    r.order_id = c.order_id
    )
    SELECT runner_id,
    	     EXTRACT('minutes' FROM AVG(arrival_time)) AS avg_arrival_time
    FROM arrival
    GROUP BY runner_id
    ORDER BY runner_id;
```
| runner_id | avg_arrival_time |
| --------- | ---------------- |
| 1         | 15               |

**Query #3** <br>
Is there any relationship between the number of pizzas and how long the order takes to prepare?
```sql
    With num_of_pizzas AS (
    SELECT order_id,
      	   order_time,
           COUNT(pizza_id) AS n_pizzas
    FROM new_customer_orders
    GROUP BY order_id, order_time
    ORDER BY order_id
    ),
    prep_time AS (
    SELECT r.runner_id,
    	     r.pickup_time,
           n.order_time,
    	     n.n_pizzas,
    	     (r.pickup_time - n.order_time) AS runner_arrival_time
    FROM new_runner_orders AS r 
    JOIN num_of_pizzas AS n ON
    r.order_id = n.order_id
    WHERE r.pickup_time IS NOT null
    )

**Query #6** <br>
What was the average speed for each runner for each delivery and do you notice any trend for these values?
```sql
    SELECT c.customer_id,
    	     r.order_id,

- runner #2 is very fast. Maybe a little TOO fast ...
- customer 102 appears to be a big tipper.

What is the successful delivery percentage for each runner?
```sql
