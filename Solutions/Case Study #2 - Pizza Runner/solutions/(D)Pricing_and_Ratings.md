**Query #1** <br>
If a Meat Lovers pizza costs $12 and Vegetarian costs $10 and there were no charges for changes - how much money has Pizza Runner made so far if there are no delivery fees?
```sql
    SELECT SUM(CASE
                   WHEN pizza_id = 1 THEN 12 
                   WHEN pizza_id = 2 THEN 10
               	   END) as income
    FROM new_customer_orders
    JOIN new_runner_orders ON
    new_customer_orders.order_id = new_runner_orders.order_id
    WHERE new_runner_orders.cancellation IS NULL;
```
| income |

**Query #2** <br>
What if there was an additional $1 charge for any pizza extras?
```sql
    With each_extra AS (
    SELECT
      new_customer_orders.order_id,
      UNNEST(STRING_TO_ARRAY(extras, ','))::NUMERIC AS extras
    FROM new_customer_orders

**Query #3** <br>
The Pizza Runner team now wants to add an additional ratings system that allows customers to rate their runner, how would you design an additional table for this new dataset - generate a schema for this new table and insert your own data for ratings for each successful customer order between 1 to 5.
```sql
    DROP TABLE IF EXISTS rating;
    CREATE TABLE ratings (
      "order_id" INTEGER,
      "customer_id" INTEGER,
      "order_time" TIMESTAMP,
      "runner_id" INTEGER,
      "rating" INTEGER);
```
```sql
    INSERT INTO ratings
    SELECT t1.order_id,
    	   t1.customer_id,
           t1.order_time,
           t2.runner_id,
           FLOOR(1 + 5 * random()) AS rating
    FROM new_customer_orders as t1
    JOIN new_runner_orders as t2 ON
    t1.order_id = t2.order_id
    WHERE t2.pickup_time IS NOT NULL;

    SELECT * FROM ratings;
```

Using your newly generated table - can you join all of the information together to form a table which has the following information for successful deliveries?
- customer_id
- order_id
- runner_id
- rating
- order_time
- pickup_time
- Time between order and pickup
- Delivery duration
- Average speed
- Total number of pizzas
```sql

**Query #5** <br>
If a Meat Lovers pizza was $12 and Vegetarian $10 fixed prices with no cost for extras and each runner is paid $0.30 per kilometre traveled - how much money does Pizza Runner have left over after these deliveries?
```sql
    With revenue AS(
    SELECT SUM(CASE
                   WHEN pizza_id = 1 THEN 12 
                   WHEN pizza_id = 2 THEN 10
               	   END) as income
    FROM new_customer_orders
    JOIN new_runner_orders ON
    new_customer_orders.order_id = new_runner_orders.order_id
    WHERE new_runner_orders.cancellation IS NULL
    ),
    payouts AS (
    SELECT (SUM(distance) * .30) AS payout
    FROM new_runner_orders
    WHERE pickup_time IS NOT NULL
    )
    SELECT ROUND((t1.income - t2.payout), 2) as profit
    FROM revenue as t1, payouts as t2;
