## A. Customer Journey

Based off the 8 sample customers provided in the sample from the subscriptions table, write a brief description about each customerâ€™s onboarding journey.

Try to keep it as short as possible - you may also want to run some sort of join to make your explanations a bit easier!

```sql
SELECT t1.customer_id,
	   t2.plan_name,
       t1.start_date
FROM foodie_fi.subscriptions as t1
JOIN foodie_fi.plans as t2 ON
t1.plan_id = t2.plan_id
WHERE t1.customer_id IN (1, 2, 11, 13, 15, 16, 18, 19)
ORDER BY t1.customer_id, t1.start_date;
```
