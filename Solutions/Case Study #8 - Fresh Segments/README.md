Danny Ma's 8-week SQL Challenge provides us multiple realistic end to end case studies that closely represent the sort of work performed in a data analytics role and includes datasets and case studies from the following domains:

* Health analytics
* Marketing analytics
* People analytics
* Financial markets
* Fast moving consumer goods
* Digital marketing

## Introduction

Danny created Fresh Segments, a digital marketing agency that helps other businesses analyse trends in online ad click behaviour for their unique customer base. Clients share their customer lists with the Fresh Segments team who then aggregate interest metrics and generate a single dataset worth of metrics for further analysis. In particular - the composition and rankings for different interests are provided for each client showing the proportion of their customer list who interacted with online assets related to each interest for each month.

Danny has asked for your assistance to analyse aggregated metrics for an example client and provide some high level insights about the customer list and their interests.

Segments or audiences are super popular in the digital marketing space and using these interests or traits of customers is a mainstay of massive businesses like Google, Facebook, Instagram, LinkedIn and other social media where there are targeted advertising.

Traditional businesses such as this client for Fresh Segments usually upload their customer emails or matched cookies into various digital marketing systems in order to generate some sort of match, usually using some machine learning methods, to other similar customers with the same interests.

Hopefully this case study helps you think about how these index metrics and compositions can be used for digital marketing!
