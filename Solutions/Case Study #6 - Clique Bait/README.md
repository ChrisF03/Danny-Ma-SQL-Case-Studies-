Danny Ma's 8-week SQL Challenge provides us multiple realistic end to end case studies that closely represent the sort of work performed in a data analytics role and includes datasets and case studies from the following domains:

* Health analytics
* Marketing analytics
* People analytics
* Financial markets
* Fast moving consumer goods
* Digital marketing

## Introduction

Clique Bait is not like your regular online seafood store - the founder and CEO Danny, was also a part of a digital data analytics team and wanted to expand his knowledge into the seafood industry!

In this case study - you are required to support Dannyâ€™s vision and analyse his dataset and come up with creative solutions to calculate funnel fallout rates for the Clique Bait online store.

This case study is based off Danny's many years working with digital datasets in consumer banking and retail supermarkets - all of the datasets are based off real datasets Danny has come across in challenging problem solving scenarios and the questions reflect similar problems which he worked on.

Campaign analysis is almost everywhere in the data world, especially in marketing, digital, UX and retail industries - and being able to analyse views, clicks and other digital behaviour is a critical skill to have in your toolbelt as a data professional!

## Data
For this case study there is a total of 5 datasets:
* users
* events
* event_indentifiers
* campaign_identifier
* page_hierarchy

An enterprise relationship diagram was not provided but we are tasked with designing one in [dbdiagram.io](https://dbdiagram.io/home) as the first step in the case study.
